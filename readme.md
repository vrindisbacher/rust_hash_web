## Rust Hashing Web

This is a simple project that implements the sha256 protocol through an API endpoint... This project is purely for learning Rust web frameworks. 

## Project Set Up 

- `src` contains all rust files. 
- The web app sits in `main.rs` 
- `models.rs` implements some structs used for database transactions 
- `schema.rs` is an autogenerated file (from `diesel`) that defines our relations
- `encrypt.rs` and `/encrypt/utils.rs` implement the sha256 protocol 

## How to get set up 

In a terminal (in the root directory), run... 
1. `cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features sqlite`
2. `diesel setup` 
3. `diesel migration run` 
4. `cargo run` 

## Test 

Using postman, or another util make a `post` request to `127.0.0.1:8080/encrypt`. You will need to set a json body like the following...

```json
{
    "id": "vrindisbacher",
    "value": "hello world"
}
```

Ensure you set the `Content-Type` header appropriately!
